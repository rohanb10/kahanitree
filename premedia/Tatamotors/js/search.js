We will do this by keeping our costs low and ecosystem viable. In FY20, challenges facing the automotive industry were aplenty, much before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. A slowing domestic economy, muted demand across other geographies, regulatory transitions (emissions, safety and axle load), pricing pressures and geo-political conflicts put our resilience to test. However, anchored to our core purpose of providing innovative mobility solutions, we leveraged our strategic strengths to become more lean, agile and operationally fit amidst the intensifying storm. We prioritised our capital expenditures towards immediately value-accretive projects, reduced working capital and curtailed overhead costs. Our new launches and strong pipeline reflect the choices we are making to consolidate our core capabilities by streamlining products, architectures and new-age technologies. We are exploring strategic alliances to ensure steady access to capital, deleverage our balance sheet and step up our play as a leading automobile manufacturer"},

FY20 was perhaps the most unpredictable year of the decade for the Indian automotive industry – entry of new OEMs, slew of launches from established OEMs, continuing pressure on liquidity, high fuel prices, revised axle load norms, mandatory transition to BSVI norms, plus weak consumer sentiments that prevailed throughout the year. Cognisant of the possible rough road ahead, we started our FY20 journey with a clear objective to take our turnaround to the next level by enriching our product portfolio, accelerating retail sales, enhancing customer experience and being even more prudent in managing liquidity and costs. Building a future-ready product portfolio Going beyond the necessary technology upgrade required for the mandatory transition to BSVI, we unveiled a comprehensive future-ready product portfolio. This included the Altroz, India’s first Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) 5-star safety-rated car (a premium hatchback built on the Alfa platform); refreshed BSVI Tiago, Tigor, Nexon and Harrier; and new launches such as the Intra to 55-tonne Prima in the CV space, with 140+ type approvals and ~19 engines. Accelerating retail with ‘Mission Zero’ The mandatory transition to BSVI norms, effective April 1, 2020, necessitated a meticulously planned strategy to minimise BSIV inventory carryover. Our early and conscious focus on retail sales, against the industry norm of wholesale, helped us achieve the target of zero BSIV vehicle stock, with the retail business recording a 13% jump over wholesale in PV and 16% in CV. Delivering superior customer experience In PV, the upward trend in Net Promotor Score (NPS) consolidated reiterating an improved perception of our brand amongst stakeholders. With the launch of Tata UniEVerse, a collaboration among Tata group companies, the EV business unlocked tremendous underlying potential by bringing forth the unique strength of each company to co-create India’s most comprehensive e-mobility ecosystem. Prudently managing liquidity and costs Contribution margins were successfully maintained despite a change in revenue mix and overall lower revenues via a rigorous cost reduction programme. All opportunities to unlock working capital, capex and receivables were intensively captured to support free cash flows. While we made good progress on the above, it wasn’t enough to mitigate the overall impact of the macro environment on our market and financial performance, further exacerbated during the last quarter with disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year, we announced strategic initiatives to make the organisation more resilient, agile and future-ready. Subsidiarisation of the PV business enables the realisation of its full potential with mutually beneficial strategic alliances and better access to products, architectures, powertrains, new-age technologies and capital. Reimagining its front end will drive superior customer experience and improve market performance. A novel, digital-led stakeholder engagement programme underlines the CV business’ endeavour towards redefining transportation with our new range of vehicles offering improved total cost of ownership. For the immediate, we remain focused on executing a senior leadership led comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to manage an effective restart and ensure the early revival of our ecosystem. With the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and partners as the utmost priority, we have resumed operations at all our plants after taking the requisite precautions. We intend to scale in a graded manner as the entire enabling support system of suppliers, dealers and customers comes up to speed. The demand scenario is expected to remain uncertain in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic even as the need for safe personal mobility evolves into a new area of focus. Accordingly, we continue to build agility to respond dynamically to the changing consumer behaviour through closer connect with our customers. We are building a profitable roadmap by reducing the break-evens, improving cash generation and deleveraging the business. A cash improvement programme of ₹6,000 crore (including a cost savings programme of ₹1,500 crore) has been called out. Our refreshed BSVI product portfolio with customised offerings and enhanced customer experience will help us improve our market share. We expect to end FY21 with positive free cash flows. Thank you for your continued trust and commitment to Tata Motors Group. Best regards, Guenter Butschek Ramsau am Dachstein, Austria, June 15, 2020"},

We are proud to be the UK’s largest automotive manufacturer, respected across the world for our outstanding award-winning products and innovative customer-focused technologies. 2020 will be remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has devastated lives and disrupted livelihoods. It is our people who make us what we are and I would like to thank everyone at Jaguar Land Rover and the Tata Motors Group for their outstanding support. Our performance Total revenues in FY20 were £23 billion, with 475,952 wholesale units (excluding wholesale from our China JV), an EBIT margin of -0.1% and a loss before tax of £422 million. Notwithstanding the impact of regulatory changes, shifting consumer tastes, Brexit and ongoing trade tensions, during the second and third quarters, sales for Jaguar and Land Rover were on a strong and profitable trajectory, underpinned by the £2.9 billion of cost and cashflow improvements achieved through our major transformation programme, Project Charge. Our decisive turnaround measures in China resulted in six months of continued double-digit Y-o-Y growth. The unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic inevitably impacted sales and profitability in the fourth quarter. Despite the many headwinds, retail sales of our all-electric Jaguar I-PACE and our all-new Range Rover Evoque increased Y-o-Y by 40.0% and 24.7%, respectively. In addition, we sold more of our halo Special Vehicle products than ever before, with over 9,500 vehicles retailed in FY20, up 64% Y-o-Y. We have reacted quickly and decisively to the pandemic, with an accelerated focus on improving cashflow and strengthening liquidity to pave the way for long-term EBIT margin improvement. Charge+, the next phase of our transformation programme, is already ahead of schedule, having achieved £600 million of savings to date against a new target of over £2 billion of cost improvements by March 2021. Our products and innovation We innovate relentlessly to create exciting and inherently diverse products with a compelling combination of British design and engineering integrity. This year, our Jaguar XE was updated with an enhanced exterior and all-new luxurious interior, focused on new technologies. Our iconic sports car, the Jaguar F-TYPE, has also been refreshed. Our leaps forward in electrification were evidenced by significant success for the Panasonic Jaguar Racing team in the Formula E championship this year. In November 2019, the ground-breaking Jaguar I-PACE added the coveted Golden Steering Wheel to its vast collection of prestigious awards. In September 2019, we launched our new Land Rover Defender to critical acclaim. It brings the latest advances in technology and connectivity, plus mild-hybrid and, soon, plug-in hybrid drivetrains. We have also expanded our electrified Land Rover line-up with our latest 1.5 litre, three-cylinder plug-in hybrid system, now available for Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport. Investing in mobility Through collaboration and continuous investment into R&D, we are leading the transition to connected, seamless and integrated mobility. Unveiled in February 2020, Project Vector is a physical representation of our Destination Zero ambition – an advanced, connected, autonomy-ready electric vehicle concept for both public and private mobility. Our purpose We are now preparing for a post-virus future in which private vehicles could play a far greater role than previously imagined. We have charted a path towards long-term sustainable growth, with a lean cost base, disciplined capital allocation, a highly skilled workforce and world-class R&D. Throughout all of this, our purpose will remain constant; to create experiences people love for life. Best regards, Dr Ralf Speth Coventry, UK, June 15, 2020"},

Dear Shareholders, It is my privilege to write to you and present the Annual Report for FY20. I hope this letter finds you safe and in good health. As you know, the global auto industry has grappled with multiple issues during the year. On one hand, we saw greater clarity emerge on Brexit; yet on the other hand, mounting trade tensions, muted global growth and enhanced regulatory norms have fundamentally changed the contours of the business environment in which we operate. Next came the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the final quarter of the year, which has ushered in a new reality for industries across the world. The Indian auto industry faced an unprecedented year, marked by significant headwinds. Domestic auto sales declined by 18% Y-o-Y in FY20, the lowest since the data series was introduced in 2001. Alongside a broad economic slowdown, regulatory changes—including changed axle load norms and the migration to BSVI emission standards—fuelled uncertainty for both consumers and suppliers. These challenges were further exacerbated in the final quarter of the year by the country’s strict lockdown measures in response to the pandemic. Against this volatile macro backdrop, your Company is charting out a disciplined path towards a robust and resilient future. I would like to first address the current year’s performance, followed by various transformative initiatives being undertaken. Tata Motors Limited (TML) Over the past two financial years, TML focused on refreshing its portfolio, improving structural efficiencies and streamlining internal processes. In doing so, TML turned a corner and delivered improved market shares, profitability, and positive free cash flows. In FY19, we delivered positive net income of `2,021 crore, after making losses for five years. In both FY18 and FY19, TML produced positive free cash flows, following five years in negative territory. However, in FY20, this turnaround journey has been interrupted, as demand deteriorated sharply on the back of an abruptly slowing economy coupled with the spread of COVID-19. In the CV segment, overall volumes declined by 34% Y-o-Y, with the Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (MHCV) segment witnessing a steep decline of 50%. However, with improved stakeholder engagement, TML managed to improve market share in both the MHCV and Intermediate and Light Commercial Vehicle (ILCV) segments by 240 bps and 180 bps, respectively, while it lost market share by 210 bps in the Small Commercial Vehicle (SCV) segment. The PV segment witnessed a volume decline of 37% and a loss of market share by 150 bps, as the Company streamlined its supply chain, exited non-core operations and implemented measures to improve ecosystem viability. During the year, TML successfully transitioned its entire product range to BSVI emission norms, with historically low levels of system inventory. I am optimistic that our BSVI portfolio will provide our customers with superior value, technology, features, and experience, positioning us as leaders in building a green and clean India. One of the highlights of the year was the launch of the Tata UniEVerse, an entire electric mobility ecosystem—from charging infrastructure, battery cells, battery packs and electric motors, to financing options, customised for the needs of electric vehicle (EV) ownership. Anchoring the ecosystem will be EVs that are aspirational, practical and affordable. TML is a market leader in the EV segment, having launched the Tigor EV and the Nexon EV during the year. And there will be more. TML will be supported by other key Tata group companies to make this unique and comprehensive solution a reality. In doing so, India has the potential to be a global electric mobility hub. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Ongoing trade conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted JLR vehicle sales in FY20, which contracted by 12% y-o-y. A significant part of the volume decline occurred in the fourth quarter of FY19-20. JLR undertook a host of structural initiatives to drive efficiencies so that, despite the decrease in volumes, the business improved its profitability during the year and reduced its cash outflows, compared with previous years. Our turnaround programme in China resulted in six months of continued double-digit Y-o-Y growth. JLR continues to develop award-winning products that combine outstanding performance and technology. This year, JLR refreshed the Land Rover Discovery Sport, the Jaguar F-Type and the Jaguar XE. The all-electric Jaguar I-Pace won the prestigious Golden Steering Wheel award this past November. JLR had a spate of product launches over the course of the year: Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport, both premium compact SUVs, are now available with Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) technology. Added to this, JLR celebrated the official opening of two world-class facilities this year: the Advanced Product Creation Centre in Gaydon and the National Automotive Innovation Centre in Warwick, one of Europe’s largest automotive R&D hubs. Both of these centres will focus on innovation that leads to connected, seamless, integrated and clean mobility. This year, Chief Executive Officer Dr Ralf Speth will retire after 10 years of dedicated service. I would like to personally thank him for his vision, unfaltering passion and commitment in leading Jaguar Land Rover, delivering new technologies and outstanding products and services. Looking ahead As we look ahead over the next two years, we anticipate a tremendous deal of transformation stemming from COVID-19. Consumer behaviour will change in numerous ways, from demanding more integrated digital experiences to prioritising health and safety features across purchasing decisions. The move to ‘slow’ travel and personal (versus public and/or shared) transport may shape future demand for passenger vehicles. Greater scrutiny will be placed on building environmental sustainability and climate resilience into the very core of business models. The Tata Motor Group is well placed to meet the demand opportunities that will arise from these important and fundamental shifts. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support as we enter a brave new decade—one that is already rewriting the rules of the past Best regards, N Chandrasekaran Mumbai, June 15, 2020"},

The Tata Motors Group has undertaken several initiatives to capitalise on the opportunities provided by circular economy. Our Group companies have been closely associated with research and innovation in this space. The initiatives range from lifecycle analysis, innovation and alternate materials to recycling and reuse, among others. Tata Motors Limited TML in India has been working on the three major pillars of reduce, reuse and recycle to minimise waste and increase resource efficiency. Apart from innovative initiatives to minimise waste generation, TML ensures that waste disposal and recycling practices are as per the applicable regulations, through authorised agencies. Rethinking business for a circular economy The Tata Prolife business division remanufactures auto components that have reached the end of their useful life. Aimed at CV owners, Tata Prolife extends the life of engine long blocks through systematic overhaul that leads to optimum performance while also adding to the life of the products. In FY20, an equivalent of 33,615 engines were reused or recycled under TML's take-back programme. There has been a consistent increase in the number of equivalent engines remanufactured every year. A 5% improvement was observed in the reporting period over the previous year, resulting in revenue generation of I247 crore. Remanufacturing of an engine not only has significant economic benefits, but also has great positive sustainability impact. Various resources, such as raw materials, energy and water, which are required for manufacturing a new engine are eliminated or significantly reduced. The Tata Prolife business has also created new business and employment opportunities, thus bringing about positive social impact. TOTAL MATERIAL SAVED DUE TO RECYCLING AT PROLIFE 3,760.1 TONNES GHG EMISSIONS AVOIDED DUE TO REMANUFACTURING OF 6BT AND ACE ENGINES AT PROLIFE 8,923.7 tCO2 Jaguar Land Rover As an early adopter of circular economy principles, JLR has long recognised that 'take, make, waste' processes threaten the availability of natural resources and the materials upon which it depends. JLR aims to do more by closing the loop on precious materials, recycling and reusing waste and materials wherever it can. Investing in new environmentally friendly technologies and processes is a vital part of JLR’s business practice. JLR's long-term goal is to partner with key innovators to support recycled material, while still maintaining high standards of safety and quality. JLR is working with the German chemical company, BASF, to pilot research around an innovative recycling process that will convert plastic waste into a new premium grade material that could feature in future vehicles. SHARE OF RECYCLED CONTENT IN JLR'S ALUMINIUM ALLOY UP TO 75% Giving aluminium a second life Aluminium is a key component of JLR's manufacturing process and vehicle design. JLR's latest project, REALITY, builds on longstanding work, such as 2016’s REALCAR initiative, finding pioneering ways to recover aluminium from end-of-life vehicles to build next-gen models. REALITY aims to recover post-consumer aluminum from sources, including end-of-life vehicles, to reform it into a new high-grade aluminium to create new vehicles. The process is currently being tested on early, pre-production Jaguar I-PACE prototypes that have had their batteries safely removed. These batteries enter into their own second-life process that JLR is developing, while the scrap from the vehicles is sorted into various materials using high-tech sensors by Axion Recycling. Once separated, the aluminium scrap could then be melted, their quality analysed, blended and reformed into a new aluminium alloy. With this project, Jaguar Land Rover expects to reduce the CO2 impact of production while reducing the amount of virgin aluminium required to produce vehicles. Between September 2013 and January 2019, around 3,20,000 tonnes of closed-loop scrap were processed back into the brand’s lightweight aluminium intensive architecture, across all vehicle lines, including the Jaguar XE."},
	{"url":"environmental-responsibility-2.html", "title":"Environmental Responsibility (Part 2)","text":"Environmental Responsibility Jaguar Land Rover JLR continues to purchase 100% REGO Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO)-backed zero carbon electricity for all core UK operations. In addition, energy-saving projects such as solar panels and LED lighting have made consistent reductions in actual consumption. JLR also uses renewable-generated electricity across its facilities in Slovakia, Brazil and Austria. In September 2019, JLR unveiled world-leading facilities at its Gaydon site in Warwickshire, building one of the UK’s most sustainable non-domestic buildings and the country’s largest automotive creation and development centre. The Gaydon site forms an integral part of JLR's Destination Zero mission and up to 20% of the energy to run its new Advanced Product Creation Centre comes from 2,800 m2 of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof. The remainder of the site's electricity is derived from 100% renewable sources. In the UK, JLR's operating CO2 emissions are down 71% versus a baseline taken in 2007, and this includes the purchase of REGObacked electricity. Moreover, the average amount of energy used to build one of JLR's vehicles has reduced by 33% since 2007. Achieving carbon neutrality A landmark of JLR’s Destination Zero journey is achieving and maintaining its carbon neutral status. The culmination of a long-term environmental management plan launched in 2009, JLR was certified on January 31, 2020 as achieving carbon neutral operations for the second consecutive year by the Carbon Trust. This official recognition confirmed that business operations met the internationally recognised PAS 2060 standard between April 2018 and March 2019 across JLR vehicle manufacturing assembly operations, engine manufacturing and product development sites in the UK. ENERGY USE AND EMISSIONS In line with the UK government's Streamlined Energy & Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework, the table below shows JLR’s UK operational energy and carbon footprint. This represents 71% of JLR's manufacturing volume for FY19. The CO2e is calculated with a location-based approach using the UK average grid intensity conversion factors (2019). However, JLR continues to purchase 100% renewable REGO-backed zero carbon electricity for all core UK operations. Continuing to drive environmental performance In 2019, JLR achieved certification to the latest ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard. After being one of the first automotive companies to receive the certification back in 1998, Britain’s biggest car maker has been quick to meet the challenge of the latest globally recognised certification. Alongside the introduction of electrified powertrains including MHEV, PHEV and the world’s first premium SUV BEV – the Jaguar I-PACE – the wider workings of the JLR management system have been perfected to achieve the ISO 14001 standard. One of the most impressive advances has been in the area of carbon emissions. 11 JLR sites have been awarded the ISO 14001 standard: Castle Bromwich, Halewood, Solihull, Wolverhampton, Fen End, Oxford Road, Gaydon and Whitley in the UK, Itatiaia (Brazil), Nitra (Slovakia) and China."},

Key elements of the ecosystem include providing charging solutions, a supplier base for EV components, vehicle financing and an immersive digital experience. Jaguar Land Rover JLR has a growing portfolio of electrified products, giving customers even more choice. Plug-in hybrid variants of the Range Rover Evoque, the Land Rover Discovery Sport and the new Land Rover Defender have been announced. The extensive research and development work that went into the all-electric Jaguar I-PACE’s creation is now being applied to JLR's next-gen electrification technologies and in the development of future vehicles. Further, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicle models will offer the option of electrification. These next-gen vehicles will be manufactured at the newly electrified plant in Castle Bromwich. The manufacture of next-gen EDUs, developed in partnership with BMW, will begin at JLR’s Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton. The start of operations at JLR’s Battery Assembly Centre in Hams Hall will also be a significant step forward. The shared mobility space has achieved a few milestones with app-based cab aggregators gaining ground. It paves way for several value-creation opportunities for various stakeholders, including generating employment opportunities for skilled drivers and helping meet the aspirations of new-age customers. The future urban travel is likely to be a composite of owned and shared vehicles, with access to ride hailing and on-demand services as well as public transport. Tata Motors Limited As aspirations start outpacing affordability and infrastructure bottlenecks, organisations need to find innovative ways to solve the current challenges of congestion, poor productivity, efficiency, transparency and accessibility prevailing within the transport ecosystem. This is a great opportunity for technological innovations in the shared mobility space. It serves as one of the most promising hotspots for new and pioneering start-ups. More than anything, it promotes customers to be responsible in their choices of mobility. TML is actively seeking partners to help it grow its presence in the shared economy. EVs are gaining a lot of traction in the shared mobility space and TML has been a front runner in this evolving segment, entering into various strategic partnerships with shared mobility solution providers. Jaguar Land Rover Increased urbanisation and localised transport policies have opened up new opportunities for Mobility as a Service (MaaS), most notably in cities. Through JLR's venture capital and mobility service arm, InMotion, it has developed new solutions in the urban mobility sector, such as THE OUT, an on-demand premium car rental service, providing London residents access to Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, and HAVN, a premium all-electric chauffeur service in London with a fleet of Jaguar I-PACEs. JLR also introduced the new concept vehicle, Project Vector, as part of its Destination Zero mission. The compact, flexible vehicle concept measures just four metres in length and is designed for the city, packaging all its battery and drivetrain components into a flat floor, to allow a variety of uses. The revolutionary interior cabin space allows seating configurations for private, or shared use and even the opportunity for commercial applications, such as last mile deliveries. Tata Motors Limited Apart from increased consumer awareness, regulatory norms in India are now stressing on features like an anti-lock braking system, a driver-side airbag, a speed warning system, a seatbelt reminder for the driver and co-driver, rear parking sensors, and new stringent requirements for full-frontal impact and offset-frontal impact, aiming to reduce the instances of road accidents and the ensuing fatalities.

	{"url":"operating-environment.html", "title":"Operating Environment (Part 1)","text":"Operating Environment Operating EnvironmentChallenges abound; opportunities in play World over, the auto industry is facing a challenging environment with the overlap of cyclical and structural issues, growing environmental concerns and unpredictable policy frameworks. STRONG HEADWINDS IN DIFFERENT MARKETS Tata Motors Limited The auto industry faced strong headwinds in FY20 amidst a slowing economy due to multiple factors, such as liquidity crisis, low freight availability to cargo operators, high fuel prices, changes in axle load norms and BSVI transition, all leading to weak consumer sentiments and subdued demand across segments. The outbreak of COVID-19 towards the year-end has significantly magnified the pre-pandemic challenges. While the overall situation still remains fluid, the general expectation is that the economy should start turning around from H2 FY21, on the back of rural recovery, normal monsoon, interventions from the government and the Reserve Bank of India, and phase-wise easing of the lockdown. Although the outlook remains uncertain, TML expects gradual recovery in sales and improvements in cash flow from H2 FY21. Jaguar Land Rover The UK formally exited the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020, with a transition period to facilitate an orderly withdrawal ending on December 31, 2020. Uncertainty remains over the future terms of trade at the end of the transition period meaning we could be subject to the World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs from January 2021. These additional costs pose an unnecessary risk to the business at a time when we have experienced unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A fifth of JLR’s retail sales in FY20 were in Europe, and JLR continues to significantly rely on its suppliers based in the EU, which accounts for 45% of the content of vehicles. Any barriers that pose a threat to frictionless trade and the free movement of parts and labour will likely have an adverse effect on JLR's business operations. Trade tensions between the US and China continued during the year and although JLR experienced a recovery in retail sales in China with double-digit Y-o-Y growth in the second and third quarters, any further escalation in trade tensions between the two countries could pose further risk to sales. Further, if governments continue to enforce protectionist policies – for example, tariffs on imported vehicles – it will likely have a negative impact JLR’s business performance. MOUNTING PRESSURE OF COMPLIANCE WITH STRICTER REGULATIONS Tata Motors Limited FY20 was the year of transition to BSVI. Accordingly, from April 1, 2020, all vehicles sold in India should be complying with the BSVI emissions norms. TML offers one of the largest BSVI portfolios, from sub-1 tonne to 55 tonne of GVW. TML has not only upgraded its existing CV and PV products with BSVI technology, but also enriched them in terms of value, technology, features and experience, to meet customers' aspirations. In line with its commitment to a green and clean environment, TML, in tandem with the Tata group, has taken the lead in driving the government's vision of electrifying India and building a comprehensive and sustainable ecosystem, by leveraging the group’s rich experience and diversified competencies. Jaguar Land Rover Despite significant improvements in fuel economy and reduction in CO2 and NOx emissions, the demand for diesel vehicles has declined – most notably in the UK and Europe. This is largely as a result of government policy and tighter regulations, several countries having pledged to bring forward their strategies to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles altogether. JLR continues to expand electrified powertrain options by offering full-battery electric, PHEV and MHEV on all of its new and refreshed model range, as well as by refining the latest technologically advanced diesel and petrol Ingenium engines to ensure compliance with emissions regulations. EMERGENCE OF COVID-19 Tata Motors Limited The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the performance in the fourth quarter. As a result, profitability was impacted by ₹500 crore and free cash flow by ₹2,000 crore. TML responded promptly to the crisis by implementing a temporary lockdown of all its plants and instituted rigorous cost and capex controls to conserve as much cash as possible. A calibrated restart of operations has been undertaken, giving utmost priority to the safety and well-being of employees, customers and ecosystem partners. Jaguar Land Rover After a return to profit in the second and third quarters, JLR's PBT was impacted by £599 million and free cash flow by £767 million owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. JLR's focus has been on conserving cash and prioritising capex into key products. JLR is seeing evidence of a recovery in sales in most markets, notably China, however, there remains considerable uncertainty about the extent, speed and regional differences of any recovery. including any longer term impacts on the business and the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic. The Solihull manufacturing facility and the Engine Manufacturing Centre in the UK, the contract manufacturing line in Graz (Austria) and the facility in Nitra (Slovakia) started production in mid-May. The Halewood facility started production in early June. The Castle Bromwich facility will reopen in due course, while the JV facility in China has been open since late February."},

Facilitating the financing process for customers and enabling the sales process, TMF plays a crucial role in supporting the sales of TML’s vehicles. For a market like India, where consumers are facing a liquidity crunch due to multiple reasons, TMF has played a key role in improving consumer experience with better financing options. With more than 270 branches across India, Tata Motors Finance is the largest financier of Tata Motors vehicles – both CV and PV. TMF’s mission statement has always been to realise our customers' dreams of owning Tata vehicles, which is also borne out in its customer segment covering the full spectrum of borrowers from first-time users and small business owners to fleet operators, dealers and vendors in the Tata Motors ecosystem. Drivers-cum-owners constitute a significant part of the CV segment. Many of TMF’s customers belong to MSMEs. TML, along with TMF, works diligently to support under-banked customers and aims to help them in augmenting their earnings and improving their livelihood by offering financing solutions to own a vehicle for commercial use. The year witnessed a slowdown in automobile industry with falling sales and piling inventory amidst an overall slowdown in the economy, hike in cost of acquisition and ownership because of increase in third-party insurance, upward revision of road and registration tax by state governments and a rise in fuel prices. Transition from BSIV to BSVI, low growth in rural wages, NBFC crisis impacting credit flow and the crippling impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-March. As a result of which, FY20 disbursements slowed down by 32% to I15,029 crore. AUM as on March 31, 2020 stood at I36,881 crore, as compared to I38,311 crore in the year earlier. Collections were also impacted, leading to increase in Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) by 250 bps to 5.1%. TMF’s market share improved by 376 bps to 30%. PBT for the year grew by 21% to I149 crore as against I123 crore in FY19. TMF realigned its strategy by taking the asset-light route. It meant disbursing in the form of financial warehousing, subsequently curating the assets for six months and then selling to market participants, which are mostly public and private sector banks. TMF continues to collect EMIs from original borrowers in the capacity of a collection agent for the assignee (bank). During the year, TMF securitised/assigned I9,325 crore worth of financial assets. TMF revisited its organisation structure to create a fit-for-future customer-centric entity focused on digitisation and operating efficiencies. As a result of which, cost to income ratios declined from 65% in FY19 to 49% in FY20. While FY20 remained a difficult year for most NBFCs, from a liquidity standpoint, TMF managed to maintain a comfortable liquidity position during the year and diversified its liability franchise by raising External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) of US$250 million (including US$100 million from the IFC), establishing fresh limits with SIDBI and MUDRA, and establishing new relationships with multinational banks like ANZ, Barclays, DBS, CTBC and KDB.

TML is looking at the EV business as a strategic opportunity to establish itself as a strong player in the new and evolving PV Industry. TML has developed a comprehensive approach to address the barriers and 'win proactively in the e-mobility space. TML showcased the largest portfolio of EVs in India at the Auto Expo 2020. TML launched the Tigor EV+ with 213 km range, which has received a strong market response. It also happens to be the highest selling EV in India. In January 2020, TML launched the Nexon EV, powered by the state-of-the-art EV technology ‘ZIPTRON’, a high voltage, high performance technology designed specifically for Indian conditions by leveraging TML’s global engineering network. Aspirational yet accessible, the Nexon EV has become the highest selling electric car in Q4 FY20. Key highlights of ZIPTRON include a zippy driving experience, long range, fast charging capability, eight years of battery and motor warranty, and IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. Going forward, TML will continue to explore and target multiple customer groups to increase its presence in the evolving EV industry. Win proactively in EV Tata UniEVerse TML has launched an EV ecosystem, the Tata UniEVerse, to closely leverage the strengths and experience of other Tata group companies to create a viable environment to drive the adoption of EVs in India. Key elements of the ecosystem include charging solution, supplier base for EV components, vehicle financing and mobility service providers. Charging solution TML has partnered with Tata Power to proactively address the challenge of charging. Both companies decided to work together to provide a suite of charging solutions for homes and workplaces and for captive and public charging. Supplier base for EV components In its attempt to build the component supplier ecosystem, TML collaborated with Tata Chemicals for manufacturing lithium-ion battery cells, exploring active chemicals manufacturing and battery recycling. TML has also collaborated with Tata AutoComp for the localisation of battery pack assembly and motor assembly. Vehicle financing For attractive financial solutions for both fleet and personal segments, TML has partnered with Tata Motors Finance and Tata Capital to introduce affordable financing solutions. Digital experience Tata Croma stores are hosting a store-in-store concept to provide an immersive digital experience for the Nexon EV. Manage challenges LEADING THROUGH THE CRISIS TML continues to engage with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees during the crisis. Operations were restarted with limited, essential staff in each plant, adhering to all mandated safety norms while efficiently meeting operational requirements. TML will scale operations in a graded manner, as the entire enabling ecosystem of suppliers, vendors, dealers and customers comes up to speed. TML is cautiously optimistic and staying agile to cater to an evolving demand. The lockdown was an opportunity to accelerate TML's digital journey and evolve new ways of working, while servicing and supporting customers. By mid of May 2020, over 400 sales outlets and 885 workshops for CVs and nearly 200 dealerships and 300 workshops for PVs had begun operations with a new set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) defining minimal interactions and maintaining prudent social distance while engaging with customers. In the recent weeks, customers have initiated new bookings, deliveries of PVs have commenced and workshops are seeing an increasing inflow of vehicles for servicing. All discussions with customers are being done virtually using digital tools and any meetings, if necessary, are being conducted with prior appointments and post verification of all requirements. Documents for vehicle insurance and registration are being collected via mail or specially installed drop boxes, and vehicle deliveries are being done only after all formalities are completed. Customer vehicles arriving at workshops for repairs and servicing too are completely sanitised before being handed over post service. In the case of test drives, limited persons are allowed on board and the vehicle is fully sanitised, including replacing the protective covers shielding the interiors of the vehicle. For its CV customers, TML extended all possible technical support to keep vehicles running during the lockdown. Additionally, timelines of vehicle warranty, free services and Tata Suraksha AMC have also been extended."},

The emphasis is on allocating resources and managing the outcomes, while ensuring alignment to the ‘turnaround’ strategy. The Turnaround 2.0 strategy was launched in FY19 to drive Competitive, Consistent and Cash-accretive growth. While TML has undertaken robust turnaround actions, it continues the journey by: emphasising operational efficiency using common platforms; initiating cost reduction and capex rationalisation programmes; leveraging on developments in EV markets; and launching a new BSVI portfolio that offers exciting features and delivers an enhanced value proposition. TML is focused on activating retail sales for both CV and PV segments, requiring close coordination with dealers in managing stocks. Through such focused action plans, smooth transition into BSVI was achieved. Key priorities include enhancing retail sales, efficiently managing dealer network inventories and improving dealer performance, profitability and network expansion. The CV industry faced significant headwinds in FY20 on account of economic slowdown, liquidity stress, stock correction due to BSVI transition and the COVID-19 pandemic towards the year-end. During the year, TML presented 14 all-new BSVI range of products across segments at the Auto Expo 2020, covering sub-1 tonne to 55 tonne GVW, with 140+ type approvals and 19 engines (including alternate fuel options), thus providing a vast array of product offerings to its customers. TML showcased the Tata 4/12 m low floor entry electric bus – the first full-electric drivetrain. The Tata Ultra T.7 Electric was also on display, as India’s first-ever intermediate commercial electric truck. In order to achieve complete customer satisfaction and sustain the same throughout the lifecycle of the vehicle, a revamped Sampoorna Seva 2.0 was launched, offering a comprehensive and complete solution for the maintenance and smooth functioning of the vehicles. Overall, CV domestic sales in FY20 were lower by 33.4% compared to FY19. Retail sales in FY20 were higher than wholesale sales by 16%. As a result, the BSIV inventory in the ecosystem was near zero. Win decisively in CV CV sales ('000 units) DOMESTIC WHOLESALE 312.3 DOMESTIC RETAIL 361.0 EXPORTS 29.7 FY20 was a challenging year for the PV business. Demand was affected due to uncertainty in the minds of customers because of the pending transition from BSIV to BSVI, the liquidity crisis after the IL&FS debacle, and rising cost of vehicle ownership, among other reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic further affected demand and supply negatively in the last quarter. TML undertook multiple actions to reduce the impact, including the entry into the rapidly expanding premium hatchback segment with the Altroz, the launch of the NEW FOREVER range of PVs, the paradigm shift in the strategy from offtake to retail and the emphasis on improving customer experience. As a result, TML introduced 'Click to drive', an end-to-end online sales experience, enabling customers to buy the car of their choice, with a click of a button, from the comfort of their homes. Overall, PV sales were lower by 37.3% and retail sales were higher than wholesale sales by 13%. This helped in significantly reducing the inventory in ecosystem to near 13,000 units (all BSVI vehicles), with no BSIV inventory remaining at the year-end.
