					We’ve often heard it said that disruption creeps up on us gradually, then suddenly. But disruption can also play out suddenly, then gradually. Many companies, even in the face of operational challenges through the sudden recent crisis, stepped up with relative ease to manage continuity of business. How Infosys, led by our CEO, Salil Parekh, our COO, U.B. Pravin Rao, and the global senior leadership, enabled 93% of its 2,40,000+ employees, across 46 countries, to work from home offers a fine illustration of this. Our remote access infrastructure was expanded 10x for virtual private network bandwidth and backend capacity scaled by 4x to support the increase in concurrent connected remote users. As many as 35,000 assets were moved to employee residences, and several more personal devices were enabled with wireless connectivity to securely connect with enterprise networks. Cloud-based remote audio, video and content collaboration platforms are integral to this landscape. With over 85% of our workforce already enabled for distributed agile working and with over 10,000 scrum masters in the Company, remote development work proved less of a challenge for us. The InfyMe app continues to connect all Infosys employees to the latest updates from advisories, to company policies and other benefits on offer, while allowing them to self-declare their health status. Meanwhile, over 9,000 trainees and interns relocated to their homes from our residential Global Education Center in Mysuru, India. They are all enabled to continue training on our digital learning platform, Lex. In addition to bite-sized content from the Foundation Program, Lex brings trainer-led lessons, a hands-on lab environment and even proctored internal certifications – all virtually – to the homes of learners. Much of this has been made possible by our digital transformation in the past two years – enabled by our virtual workspaces, secure polycloud environment, micro-survey services for our digital platforms, services curated in our service store and tools for remote collaboration.

					But the real test will come in the following months when we must find ways to understand and respond to the gradually evolving dynamics of the new normal. Technology will prove an ally here. That said, building systems and operating models at enterprisescale is an exercise in factoring scale intrinsically into the design of solutions. For example, our systems were severely tested in their ability to scale when for a multinational telecommunications company, we leveraged Launchpad, our remote employee onboarding platform, to include their employees, spread across three countries, into a new project environment with access to over 200 IT applications, network operations and six large data centers connecting ~16,000 servers. For another American multinational in the food business, we are now leveraging our Live Enterprise Application Platform to enable remote knowledge transfer for their global project teams while digitizing all their standard operating procedures. <span class="d-none d-lg-inline">The task then is to build systems that can quickly scale and evolve to serve the changing needs of the enterprise and its workforce. That is the thinking that guides us as we navigate our clients to respond intuitively to opportunities, and help build value chains that are both efficient and robust to deal with unexpected challenges. That is the resilience our clients seek. That is Live Enterprise.</span>

					The post-cloud era – characterized by increasingly intelligent, autonomous and self-healing digital infrastructure – is bringing our industry the opportunity to do so much more. Our strong balance sheet, great growth momentum, scaled digital systems for our people to deliver collaboratively and an executive management team relentlessly focused on executing our digital strategy, uniquely position Infosys to deal with the unprecedented challenges of these times and help our clients navigate to the next normal.
